# Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN)

## Introduction

This project explores the implementation and research of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN). QCNN is a novel approach that leverages the principles of quantum computing to perform convolutional operations, which are pivotal in many machine learning tasks. This repository contains the code and resources needed to understand, implement, and experiment with QCNN.

## Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth setup process, it is highly recommended to use Conda or Miniconda for managing dependencies and creating a virtual environment. Conda helps to avoid potential conflicts between package dependencies and makes it easier to manage different environments.

### Install Conda/Miniconda

If you don't have Conda or Miniconda installed, you can download and install Miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the necessary packages.

### 1. Create and Activate Conda Environment

```bash
# Create a new conda environment named qcnn
conda create --name qcnn python=3.8

# Activate the conda environment
conda activate qcnn
