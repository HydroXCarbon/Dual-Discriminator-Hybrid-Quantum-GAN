# Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN)

## Introduction

This project explores the implementation and research of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGAN). QGAN is an innovative approach that combines the power of quantum computing with the generative capabilities of GANs to create quantum-enhanced generative models. This repository contains the code and resources needed to understand, implement, and experiment with QGANs.

## Prerequisites

To ensure a smooth setup process, it is highly recommended to use Conda or Miniconda for managing dependencies and creating a virtual environment. Conda helps to avoid potential conflicts between package dependencies and makes it easier to manage different environments.

### Install Conda/Miniconda

If you don't have Conda or Miniconda installed, you can download and install Miniconda from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the necessary packages.

### 1. Create Conda Environment

```bash
conda create --name qgan python=3.8
```

### 2. Activate Conda Environment
```bash
conda activate qgan
```

### 3. Install requirement packages
```bash
pip install .
```
